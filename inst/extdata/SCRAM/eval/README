This folder contains the evaluation databases for the AERMOD dispersion model (dated 02222).
Each subfolder contains the raw inputs and outputs for AERMET, AERMAP (if applicable), BPIP 
(if applicable) and AERMOD.  A separate subfolder containing the observed concentration data 
is provided.  Subfolders are also provided for other models included in the evaluation.

**	The DAEC database included some elevated terrain, which was included in the 
	final evaluation results.

***	Martin's Creek included some limited downwash effect due to nearby cooling towers,
